# Exercise 4.1
# Postitive and negative feed-back

# What is the typical fixed point structure of a negative feedback loop?
    # A single stable fixed point is common, so the system settles at one equilibrium state.
    # The negative feedback loop ensures that the system corrects deviation which contributes to a higher stability.

# Negative feedback loops are often present in homeostatic systems. What is homeostasis? 
# Give two examples of homeostatic systems in biology.
    # Homeostasis is the abiloty of a biologiacal system to maintain a stable internal environment despite external fluctuations. 
    # Examples for homeostasis systems:
        # Blood glucose regulation (glucose levels regulated by negative feedback of insulin and glucagon)
        # Body temperature control (temperature stability maintained by responses like sweating or shivering triggered by the hypothalamus)

# Systems with positive feedback loops can exhibit bistability. What is bistability?
    # Bistability describes a system thet has two stable fixed points. The System can exist in either of the two points depending on the conditions.

# What are possible biological roles of bistability?
    # Bistability enables irreversible transitions between states (like cell differentiation)
    # It also allows to maintain a state when the stimulus is removed and allows decision making.

# What are the constraints on cooperativity that are nessecary for bistability?
    # For high cooperativity with bistability, the system needs a strong enough positive feedback to create two stable states but not too strong thet the system is being destabilized.
