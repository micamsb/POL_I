# Exercise 5.3
# Diffusion through an outer membrane pore

# In the lecture, we discussed diffusion through channels using the example of a nuclear pore.
# Similar passive transport mediates exchange of small molecules between the periplasm and extracellular space in bacteria.
# OmpA (Outer membrane protein A) for example has an estimated pore diameter of 1nm and length of the channel is around 5nm.
# Calculate the net number of sugar molecules that go through one pore of these dimensions per second if the concentration difference across the membrane is 5µM.

# Estimate the diffusion constant of glucose at room temperature assuming the viscosity of the medium is η= 0.0025N s/m2 and the radius of a glucose molecule is 0.3nm.

# Sketch the concentration profile inside the pore and on both sides of the pore. Why can you assume this profile?

# Use the expression for the flux through a pore derived in the lecture to estimate the flux through the pore.
