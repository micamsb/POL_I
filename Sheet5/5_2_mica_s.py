# Exercise 5.2
# Estimate diffusion coefficients

# The Stokes-Reinstein relation allows us to estimate diffusion coefficients simply from the size of the particle, the viscosity and temperature.
# The relation applies to an idealized situation, but it is a very powerful tool to estimate a quantity that is otherwise difficult to obtain.
# Use the Stokes-Einstein relation to estimate the diffusion coefficients of ATP, actin monomers & vesicles with radius 100nm in water and the cytosol.
# Water & ATP

# Water & actin monomers

# Water & vesicles

# Cytosol & ATP

# Cytosol & actin monomers

# Cytosol & vesicles

# Look up the size of these particles, approximate them roughly as a sphere, and estimate the diffusion coefficient.

# Estimate how long it takes for these particles to diffuse 1µm and 10µm.
